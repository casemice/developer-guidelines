# Development Tools Setup

## VS Code

We highly recommend VS Code for development and provide a .vscode folder out-of-the-box which includes the recommended extensions, debugger configuration, and settings

For the best Developer Experience these extensions are highly suggested:

- Eslint
- Prettier
- Chrome debugger
- Jest

These are the basic building blocks in the boilerplate.

## Chrome Extensions

For a better debugging and development experience we suggest [React Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) and [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd). In the boilerplate, Redux is configured with this extension in mind so that you can debug and monitor your state changes very easily.
